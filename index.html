				<p class="font-weight-bold"> I generally don't like using labels because they are often inaccurate. But, given the opportunity to brand myself in order to prevent being prejudicially placed in a less desirable and less accurate group, I will declare that I identify with a lesser-known cohort termed "Xennials". <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jiawertz/2018/04/19/analog-digital-xennials-present-unique-opportunity-for-marketers/#3f7f810766ba" class="link">This </a>link from Forbes.com gives an <i>excellent</i> description of this newly coined "micro-generation" that straddled the shift from analog to digital in the 1980s and '90s. It has been defined as those born between 1977 and 1983, of which I am smack-dab in the middle. I remember well VCRs, cassette tapes and the like, but I was also young enough to easily adapt to the digital age with CDs, DVDs, PCs, and the modern smart devices. Because of that pre-digital experience, I don't have as much of a dependence on things like social media or digital maps. I like to use technology when it is useful, but I see it as a hinderance when overused, and I very much appreciate the value of "unplugging" and 'getting away' from the machines.</p>
				<p class="font-weight-bold"> On a more distinctive level, I am from Texas, born and raised, where I enjoyed living in the rural suburbs most of that time. Church, including the one I was brought up in, and the one I converted to, has always been a major part of my life. After high school, I attended junior colleges in two different time periods, mixed with a variety of jobs and wondering about where my path would lead. Eventually, I made it back to college for the 3rd time (at least) and made it stick. In 2008, Christie, whom I met in church, was convinced to marry me :), and we tied the knot in the Seattle Washington Temple of our church. My first child, Lucy, was born at the end of my junior year in college. In 2010 I graduated from the University of North Texas with a B.A. in Mathematics. After my first year of teaching high school math, I moved here to Arizona 7 years ago with my pregnant(again) wife. Since then, we’ve been blessed with 3 more children: Lydia, Jacob, and then Charlotte.</p>
				<p class="font-weight-bold"> The bouncing around from one job to the next continued here in Arizona, when on a fateful day on our way back from a family reunion in Montana, my wife saw an ad for the University of Arizona’s coding bootcamp. After some consideration, we decided to do it. I am very satisfied in the direction this class is leading me in. Part of me likes to tell myself that “I should have done this years ago”, but the more reasonable part of me says “yes, but good thing you’re doing it now”.</p>
				<p class="font-weight-bold"> I look forward to using the skills, experience, and relationships I am building to get a new job. I have a number of things that, through the years, I have wanted to create, but did not have the know-how. I believe I can contribute much to our society and hopefully earn a decent living doing so.</p>
